# Things

I generally try to minimize the quantity of physical objects in my life. There is an old tibetan saying "If you have a yak you have a yaks worth of problems". Which is to say if you aren't careful the things you own will own you. 

In any case I decided to write down somewhere in the cyberspace (here) a (short) list of things that have improved my quality of life in case they also benefit anyone else.

## The [Aranet4](https://amzn.to/4dwRW2o) $CO_2$, humidity and temperature monitor
The magnitude of which this has improved my quality of life supprised me. It turns out CO2 above 1000 PPM can could lose of focus, fatigue, brain fog, and sleep quality. Normal outdoor CO2 levels are about 400 PPM. This is something that airfilters cannot filter for and thus is address by opening a window or better ventilation. 

After I got my first one I had noticed my indoor CO2 levels where often about 1000 PPM. After a rough night of sleep i would find poor sleep also was coorolated with high CO2 levels. I know have three of them, one for my living room / office, one for my bedroom, and one for traveling. 

Thats all for now... or maybe ever.
